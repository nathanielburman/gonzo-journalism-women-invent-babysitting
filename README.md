This is a Gonzo Journalists true account of events that unfolded in Home Economics circa 1999.

look up gonzo journalists before reading this and thinking that this is actually the truth. Gonzos are telling the truth about how they feel...

The date was 1999 and it was our turn to watch, the, babies. White teachers handed out plastic babies and baby parts while the boys learned how to microwave, baby, parts. All these white girls got a taste of the easy life. It started with one white girl who needed to go to a friends house. She got caught neglecting the plastic child! Got in big trouble... Well, her friends were more important than the needs of the plastic monster. Then one of these white girls came up with the most brilliant of ideas. All these kids were crying for attention that they never receive from some. What these women needed was to beat the system! That was how babysitting was invented, circa 1999. I made 150$ that week watching and feeding plastic babies and putting heads back on.

Did you know that schools handed out plastic Ai babies back in 1999? I wonder why they don't do that anymore... or are they?
